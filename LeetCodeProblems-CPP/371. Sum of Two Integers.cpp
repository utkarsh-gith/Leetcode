/*
Approach: Bitwise Addition Without Using '+' or '-'

- The goal is to add two integers `a` and `b` without using arithmetic operators.
- This can be achieved using bitwise operations:

  1. XOR (^) simulates addition **without carry**:
     - Example: 5 ^ 3 = 6 (binary addition without carrying)

  2. AND (&) followed by left shift (<<) simulates the **carry**:
     - (a & b) finds carry bits
     - (a & b) << 1 shifts them to their correct position

- Repeat this process:
    - Update `a` with the XOR result (partial sum)
    - Update `b` with the new carry
- Stop when `b` becomes 0 (no more carry)

- Works for both positive and negative numbers due to two's complement representation.

Time Complexity: O(1) â€” at most 32 iterations (for 32-bit integers)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
