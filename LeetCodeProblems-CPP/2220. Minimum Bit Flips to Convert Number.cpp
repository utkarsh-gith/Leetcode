/*
Approach: XOR and Count Set Bits

- To convert `start` to `goal`, we need to flip the bits where they differ.
- XOR (`start ^ goal`) gives a number where:
    - Each bit is 1 if the bits in `start` and `goal` differ at that position.
- So, the number of 1's in the XOR result is the number of bit flips needed.

- Use Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm to count set bits in the XOR result:
    - Repeatedly do: x = x & (x - 1)
    - Increment count for each iteration.

Time Complexity: O(1) â€” since integers are 32-bit max  
Space Complexity: O(1)
